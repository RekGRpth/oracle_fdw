This is a list of things that would be nice to have.
Help is welcome!

- Set parameters like NLS_DATE_FORMAT *after* the Oracle connection has been
  established.  Otherwise, an ill-guided Oracle logon trigger could mess up
  our NLS settings.
  This should not be too hard, but nobody has got around to do it so far.

The following features would be nice to have, but prior attempts to add them
have failed, which was not necessarily the fault of the contributors.

- Add a sample Docker file to build a container with PostgreSQL and oracle_fdw.
  This can also serve as a cookbook for installing the software.
  The main problem here is that we'd need a maintainer who knows about Docker.
  See https://github.com/laurenz/oracle_fdw/pull/644

- Aggregate pushdown.
  This is a big feature, and the main challenge is to write a patch that can
  be understood and reviewed by the maintainers.
  See https://github.com/laurenz/oracle_fdw/issues/569
